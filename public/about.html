<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Since childhood, I've always been drawn to solving problems—whether it was fixing a broken toy, figuring out puzzles, or trying to understand how things work around me. 
That curiosity has only grown over the years, evolving into a deep passion for creating real-life solutions through technology. I’m driven by the idea of building applications that make life easier, more efficient, or simply more enjoyable for others. 
Whether it’s improving a daily task or addressing a bigger societal issue, I find great satisfaction in using creativity and logic to bring practical ideas to life.</p>

<p></p>Outside of my problem-solving mindset, music plays a huge role in my life. I’m a big fan of R\&B, and d4vd is easily my favorite artist—his sound hits that perfect balance of emotion and rhythm that keeps me inspired. 
When I’m not listening to music, you’ll probably find me gaming. I dive into video games during my leisure time, often playing non-stop for 2 to 3 hours. 
It’s not just about entertainment—it also keeps my mind sharp and helps me unwind, recharging me for the next creative challenge.
